E-Commerce Transaction Data Analysis (R)
1. Project Overview:

This project analyzes e-commerce transaction data to understand customer spending behavior, identify abnormal purchase patterns, and visualize sales trends using R programming.
The analysis helps startups and businesses make data-driven decisions by converting raw transaction data into meaningful insights through visualizations.

2. Objectives: 

1.Analyze customer transaction amounts
2.Detect abnormal or outlier purchase behavior
3.Understand monthly sales intensity
4.Apply data visualization techniques using R

3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains e-commerce transaction records with attributes such as:
Transaction Date
Transaction Amount
Customer purchase details
(Dataset is used only for academic and learning purposes)

4.Tools & Technologies
Language: R

Libraries Used:
ggplot2 – Data visualization
dplyr – Data manipulation
lubridate – Date handling

Platform: RStudio

5. Visualizations Implemented:

1.Histogram
2.Shows distribution of transaction amounts
3.Helps understand customer spending patterns
4.Boxplot
5.Detects outliers and abnormal purchase values
6.Useful for fraud and anomaly detection
7.Heatmap
8.Displays monthly sales intensity
9.Highlights high and low sales periods

6.Experiment Scenario:

A startup analyzes e-commerce transaction data to:

Understand customer spending behavior

Detect unusual purchase patterns

Improve marketing and sales strategies

7.How to Run the Project:

Clone the repository

Open the R script in RStudio or Google Colab
